<!--
In this game you need to move the basket right of left across the screen
using left and right arrow buttons trying to catch as many fruit
as you can. The fruit are continuously falling from above. Different types of fruit give you
different score. The order is this (from highest to lowest scoring:)
melon -> pineapple -> orange -> apple -> banana. The score also depends on the speed
the fruit is falling at. The faster it is falling, the more score you get.
The game keeps tracks of your total score, the number of fruit you missed, and how many you caught.
Upon missing 10 pieces of fruit, the game is over. You can restart the game by pressing ENTER
on the game over screen. The game also shows the hi score which updates at the game over screen
if you succeeded to beat it.

The game also uses music and a couple of sound effects.
